abstract={We have investigated the indoor geolocation based on signal strength modeling. Linear, compensated linear, and multiple regression methods have been applied to set up signal strength models by using simulated data. We have also analyzed this modeling method to better understand the relation between the location error and the signal strength error. Some important results have been obtained to help us determine proper placement of access points (APs) and evaluate the range of location error. A simulation experiment has been conducted based on typical parameters of IEEE802.11b MAC},
